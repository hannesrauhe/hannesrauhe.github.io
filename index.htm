<h2>Hannes Rauhe</h2>
<p> Hi there, I'm Hannes, a passionate engineer and developer currently working at the <a
        href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de">Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)</a>.
    My PIK profile page is <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/hannesra/homepage">here</a>.
    Before I designed and implemented database systems for 10 years at SAP and 2 more years at AWS in the Aurora
    Limitless project.
    In my free time I work on various small and short-lived software projects that you can find on <a
        href="https://github.com/hannesrauhe">Github</a>.
    In addition I'm a lifeguard at the <a href="https://potsdam.dlrg.de/">DLRG in Potsdam</a> and I'm one of the hosts
    of the German radio show <a href="https://radio.ccc-p.org/">"Chaos im Radio"</a>.
    As a big fan of free and open source software, I try not to use proprietary platforms, so feel free to <a
        href="https://chaos.social/@hannesrauhe">follow me on Mastodon</a>.

        Processor for the Job - Co-Processors in a DBMS</a>.
