<h2>Hannes Rauhe</h2>
<p>
I'm a passionate database developer at AWS. Before that I worked on database systems for 12 years at SAP. In my free time I work on various small and short-lived software projects that you can find on <a href="https://github.com/hannesrauhe">Github</a>. In addition I'm one of the hosts of the German radio show <a href="https://radio.ccc-p.org/">"Chaos im Radio"</a>. As a big fan of free and open source software, I try not to use proprietary plaftorms, so feel free to <a href="https://chaos.social/@hannesrauhe">follow me on Mastodon</a>.

If you are looking for my PhD thesis, that's here: <a href="http://notapaper.de/files/thesis_druck.pdf">Finding the Right Processor for the Job - Co-Processors in a DBMS</a>. While I was working on the thesis I also blogged on <a href="http://notapaper.de">notapaper.de</a>. Most of the experiments are now (as of 2021) more than 7 years old, but I still believe the general outcome is the same.
